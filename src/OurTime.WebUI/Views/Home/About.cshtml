    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        We are a close-knit team of experienced watchmakers with a passion for time, precision, and design. 
        After many years in the industry, we realized something was missing – a brand where traditional craftsmanship meets modern aesthetics. 
        In 2025, we set out to fill that niche.

    <p>
        Our watches are handcrafted in small, carefully monitored batches to ensure the highest quality. 
        Each model is the result of genuine watchmaking, designed and assembled with meticulous care in our workshop.

        Welcome to our world – where Time is Of The Essence.
